\begin{questions}
\question [25] A coin is thrown independently 10 times to test the hypothesis
that the probability of heads is $p=0.5$ versus the alternative that the
probability is not 0.5. The test rejects if either 0 or 10 heads are observed.

\begin{parts}
\part What is the significance level $(\alpha)$ of the test?
\part If, in fact, the probability of heads is 0.10, what is the power of the
test?
\end{parts}

\question [25] A producer specifies that the mean lifetime ofa certain type of
battery is at least 240 hours. A sample of 18 such batteries yields the
following data:

\[
237, 242, 244, 262, 225, 218, 242, 248, 243, 234, 236, 228, 232, 230, 254, 220, 232, 240
.\] 

Assuming that the life of the batteries is approximately normally distributed,
do the dat indicate that the specifications are not being met?

\question [25] Consider two different producers of a type of rocket powder. A
sample of 10 units is selected from each producer and their burning times in
seconds are recorded. This results in the data below. Test the hypothesis that
the average burning times are equal. What assumptions are you making?

Producer 1

\[
50.7, 54.8, 48.6, 36.9, 52.4, 51.6, 53.0, 38.0, 42.2, 50.3
.\] 

Producer 2

\[
60.3, 58.8, 56.2, 48.6, 40.0, 42.8, 58.0, 44.3, 55.0, 48.6
.\] 

\question [25] Supose that $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_{n}$ is a random sample from a
$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ distribution.

\begin{parts}
\part If $\sigma^2$ is known, find a minimum value for $n$ to guarantee that a
0.95 confidence interval for $\mu$ will have length no more than $\sigma / 4$.

\part If $\sigma^2$ is unknown, find a minimum value for $n$ to guarantee, with
probability 0.90, that a 0.95 confidence interval for $\mu$ will have length
no more than $\sigma / 4$.
